# Mahdi Mirzadeh

Hi I am Mahdi Mirzadeh, I was born in Fall-2003 and I currently live in Iran, I love computer related stuff and I spend quite some time learning about them.
I'm interested in FOSS (Free Open Source Software) and have been using GNU+Linux for my main machine since 2018.

## GNU+Linux is not just an OS, It's a journey

My Unix-like Operating System journey:

- Early 2016:

Installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (the Unity Desktop days) dual-booted with windows 7 x86 (Debloated), and started using Ubuntu for web browsing & media, and win7 for playing counter-strike 1.16.

Nothing crazy or any new knowledge about linux or shell scripting, just trying to learn how it works and continueing my web-developement freelancer-ish job.

- Late 2016:

Not so long after installing Ubuntu, I deleted my Ubuntu partition from win7's disk management software in order to install Manjaro (don't do that), and after rebooting my pc, to my surprise nothing showed up, and I haven't burned Manjaro to my thumb-drive, so I guess I took it to someone and they installed windows 7 and I just kept it that way for sometime.

- 2017:

After my father bought me a new laptop, the laptop's firmware wasn't supported by windows 7, so I was forced to install windows 10 x64, which sucks by every measurement, THANK YOU MICROSOFT! I could download Manjaro with your OS, it doesn't suck that much I guess. And so I continued my GNU+Linux journey.

- 2019:

By this time, I've spent time learing more about lpic, network, bash scripting, played with servers, more indepth C programming and using FOSS. My understanding of GNU+Linux as a desktop user was more than enough, but it all changed, when I got involved in the Linux communities online, and thought my tools are important and in order to become and elite, I need to use Arch.

SO I DID! I USED ARCH BTW! AND I TOLD NO ONE ABOUT IT, BECAUSE IT WAS EVEN CRINGE BACK THEN AND I DIDN'T WANT TO VOLUNTEERLY MAKE MYSELF LESS SOCIAL.

But as I became more elite (because I used ArchLinux), My desktop environment (xfce) also needed to be gone, and I began trying out Window Manager hopping:

(2019) xfce -> spectrwm -> i3-wm -> qtile -> xmonad -> bspwm | openbox -> dwm (2021)

- 2021:

I became more interested in [suckless philosophy](http://suckless.org/philosophy/) and avoided bloated software, made my own builds of dwm, st, tabbed, surf, dmenu, slock, oksh, neatvi ... and completely moved to cli/tui applications [(check my dotfiles)](https://git.mirzadeh.pro/dotfiles). Also:

ArchLinux -> AlpineLinux -> FreeBSD | OpenBSD (2022)

- 2022:

I started using OpenBSD on my pc and FreeBSD on my laptop, I've learned a lot more about kernel patching, BSDs, and the actual Unix.
