title: My First Blog Post
description: Why I started this blog and what I hope to accomplish with it.
--->

This is my first blog post. I'm starting this blog for two reasons:

1. **To practice my English.** I'm a non-native speaker. Writing in English helps me improve. If you find mistakes, that's expected. I'll get better over time.

2. **To share my thoughts.** I spend a lot of time with computers, Unix-like systems, shell scripting, and minimal software. I want to write about what I learn and build.

## What this blog is about

I'll write about:

- Unix-like operating systems (Linux, BSDs)
- Shell scripting and automation
- Minimal, suckless software philosophy
- System administration and packaging
- Tools I build and use

Nothing fancy. Just technical notes and thoughts.

## Why a blog?

Because a blog is mine. I control the content, the design, the domain. No algorithm decides what you see. No ads. No tracking. Just plain HTML served from my server.

This website is built with a static site generator I wrote in POSIX shell. It's simple, fast, and portable. The source is Markdown, the output is HTML. No runtime, no database, no JavaScript (unless absolutely necessary).

You can read more about my approach to static sites in future posts.

## What to expect

I'll write when I have something to say. No schedule, no pressure. Quality over quantity.

If you want to follow along, there's an [RSS feed](/blog.xml); otherwise just check back whenever.

Thanks for being here.
