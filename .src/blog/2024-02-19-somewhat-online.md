description: A brief update from military service leave (February 2024).
--->

I'm writing this during مرخصی (leave). Back at base, there are no smartphones, no computers, no internet. Nothing. Just time moving very slowly.

At home, time moves at the speed of light. A few days of leave and it's gone.

## Why I'm not active

No tech access at base means no coding, no commits, no blog posts. The servers are running fine (static sites don't need babysitting), but everything else is on hold.

I check email and GitHub when I'm on leave. That's about it.

## When this ends

Service ends later this year. Until then, posts will be rare. Projects are paused. That's just how it is.

Back to base soon.
