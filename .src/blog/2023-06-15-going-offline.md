title: Going Offline
description: Preparing for military service and a long break from computing (June 2023).
--->

I've enlisted for military service in Iran. Training starts in July and I'll be mostly offline for several months if not for years.

## What I'm doing before I leave

- **Backups**: dotfiles, repos, server configs pushed to GitHub and my stagit mirror.
- **Automation**: cron jobs for system updates, monitoring scripts, failover configs.
- **Delegation**: handed off customers' projects, putting the rest in an archive.

## What I'll miss

Daily computing. Shell scripting. Working on my tools. WM hopping. Watching [Luke Smith](https://lukesmith.xyz/) and [Mental Outlaw](http://www.youtube.com/@MentalOutlaw) at 2am.

## What I'm not worried about

The servers will run. The scripts will work. Static sites don't break. That's why I built things this way.

See you on the other side.
